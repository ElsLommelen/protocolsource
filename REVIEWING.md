# Reviewing pull requests

Reviewers can proceed like this:

1.  To preview the rendered version:

    ```         
    1.   If you have cloned the protocolsource repo, checkout the branch you need to review and use `protocolhelper::render_protocol("<enter the protocolcode here>")` to render the protocol
    2.   Alternatively, ask the author of the protocol to do this for you. The author can then upload a zip-archive of the rendered protocol to the conversation pane of the pull request or pass the rendered version to you via google drive or similar.
    ```

2.  [Review the protocol](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) with the aid of the rendered version.
